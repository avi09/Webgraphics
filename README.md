# Webgraphics  
Working with Web Graphics from scratch to enhance UI development, and make design more visually attractive.  

Using WebGL graphics in JavaScript which render geometry directly from GPU. Incorporated randomness in moving particles based off skewed arbitrarily colored 3D shapes, and rendered it with vertex and fragment shaders.

## Working  
1. Compiling Vertex and Fragment shaders  
2. Initializing Buffers  
3. Adding face colors and vertex to objects  
4. Configuring the rotations around all axes  
5. Configuring translation rates
6. Adding Random translations
7. Rendering the scene repeatedly with new values
